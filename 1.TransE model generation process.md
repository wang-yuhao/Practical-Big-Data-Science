# 1.pre-process dataset
# 2.build model
## 2.1 Generate negative sampling
### 2.1.1 According [batch_size] split the entities to [pos_batch]:
e.g.
#### + [pos_triples]
| subject | relation | object |
|-|-|-|
| s1 | r1 | o1 |
| s2 | r2 | o3 |
...
| s(10*batch_size) | r(10*batch_size) | o(10*batch_size) |

#### + [pos_batches]:Split [pos_triples] into [pos_batches]
| subject | relation | object |
|-|-|-|
| s1 | r1 | o1 |
| s2 | r2 | o3 |
...
| s(batch_size) | r(batch_size) | o(batch_size) |

| s(batch_size+1) | r(batch_size+1) | o(batch_size+1) |
|-|-|-|
| s1 | r1 | o1 |
| s2 | r2 | o3 |
...
| s(2*batch_size) | r(2*batch_size) | o(2*batch_size) |

| s(2*batch_size+1) | r(2*batch_size+1) | o(2*batch_size+1) |
|-|-|-|
| s1 | r1 | o1 |
| s2 | r2 | o3 |
...
| s(10*batch_size) | r(10*batch_size) | o(10*batch_size) |

#### + [pos_batch]:through for loop assign each batch to [pos_batch]
| subject | relation | object |
|-|-|-|
| s1 | r1 | o1 |
| s2 | r2 | o3 |
...
| s(batch_size) | r(batch_size) | o(batch_size) |

### 2.1.1 Add corrupted negative samples:
#### + [subject_based_corrupted_triples]:
| subject | relation | object |
|-|-|-|
| s1' | r1 | o1 |
| s2' | r2 | o3 |
...
| s(batch_size/2)' | r(batch_size/2) | o(batch_size/2) |

#### + [object_based_corrupted_triples]:
| subject | relation | object |
|-|-|-|
| s(batch_size/2 + 1) | r(batch_size/2 + 1) | o(batch_size/2 + 1)' |
| s(batch_size/2 + 2) | r(batch_size/2 + 2) | o(batch_size/2 + 2)' |
...
| s(batch_size) | r(batch_size) | o(batch_size)' |

#### + [neg_batch]: [subject_based_corrupted_triples] + [object_based_corrupted_triples] 
| subject | relation | object |
|-|-|-|
| s1' | r1 | o1 |
| s2' | r2 | o3 |
...
| s(batch_size/2)' | r(batch_size/2) | o(batch_size/2) 
| s(batch_size/2 + 1) | r(batch_size/2 + 1) | o(batch_size/2 + 1)' |
| s(batch_size/2 + 2) | r(batch_size/2 + 2) | o(batch_size/2 + 2)' |
...
| s(batch_size) | r(batch_size) | o(batch_size)' |

## 2.2 Compute the Loss
### Split pos_batch and neg_batch to s,r,o
### compute pos_batch_score and neg_batch_score
### through nn.MarginRankingLoss compute the loss

#TODO add relative code
